# Agile Implementation Plan for Microservice System

## Project Overview
Implementation of a distributed, event-driven microservice system built with Spring Boot and managed with Gradle (Kotlin DSL). The system demonstrates enterprise integration patterns, asynchronous event processing (Kafka/JMS), and a scalable cloud-native architecture.

## Risk Management

### High Priority Risks
1. **Integration Complexity**: Multiple services need to communicate effectively
   - Mitigation: Implement comprehensive integration testing early
   
2. **Data Consistency**: Distributed system challenges with transaction management
   - Mitigation: Implement Saga pattern and eventual consistency

3. **Performance**: High-traffic services might face scaling issues
   - Mitigation: Use caching (Redis) and asynchronous processing

### Medium Priority Risks
1. **Security**: Multiple entry points increase attack surface
   - Mitigation: Implement OAuth2/JWT and security best practices
   
2. **Monitoring**: Distributed system complexity for debugging
   - Mitigation: Implement centralized logging and distributed tracing
